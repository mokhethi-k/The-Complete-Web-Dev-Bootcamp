        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, I’m Kabelo Mokhethi, a passionate Control and Instrumentation Specialist with a strong foundation in electrical engineering and hands-on experience in brewing and hydropower industries. 
            Over the years, I have honed my skills in electrical systems, PLC programming, and industrial networks to ensure smooth operations and optimize system performance in complex manufacturing environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I work as a Brewing Electrician at Maluti Mountain Brewery (AB InBev), where I specialize in maintaining and troubleshooting brewing control systems and networks, including Braumat/Sistar, Profibus, and Profinet. 
            Previously, I served as an Electrical and Instrumentation Intern at ‘Muela Hydropower Station, where I gained valuable experience monitoring critical processes with ABB 800xA and managing instrumentation for hydropower systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            My expertise extends to Siemens PLCs (S7-300, S7-1200, S7-1500), IFM IO-Link sensors, and advanced tools like TIA Portal and AVEVA Edge 2020. 
            With a commitment to continuous learning and innovation, I am driven to provide solutions that enhance operational efficiency while maintaining safety and reliability.
            Outside of work, I am a collaborative problem-solver who enjoys tackling technical challenges, learning about emerging technologies, and contributing to the growth of industrial automation and control systems.
